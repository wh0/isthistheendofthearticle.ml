# What?

I'm going to say, sans citation of any sort, that the gamut of attention spans given to reading an article displayed on a phone falls qualitatively short of some possibly nostalgic ideal.
And in commercial publishing, there is an inescapable pressure to design for this capricious state of mind brought by so many readers to the modern news website.
I have no doubt of the incentives that call for and the internal studies that verify, among countless other innovations that so caringly spangle a comparatively unstimulating wall of text, the bullet points of related articles, the advertisements for competing cellular providers, the pictures and videos of other high profile stories, and even the interactive offers to buy a subscription to the site, thrust onto your screen under the bold hypothesis that the site's works are so boring that you'd gladly fill it out instead of reading on.

Yet these pressures are met with a challenge in visual design.
The physical width of a handheld screen circumscribes decades of established practice.
The focus in current mobile web design, or the only option, to put it more drastically, is having a single column and having every element take up the full width.
At the threshold where text meets another element, whether the other element intervenes temporarily or follows after the end of the text, one wonders which case it is, posing the question that sits at the core of this site, "Is this the end of the article?"

This site presents a longitudinal study-in-progress of the techniques that designs across the web use to signal that a given transition from paragraph text to other content happens at the end of an article.
In the encounters exhibited on this site, I present a screenshot of an article at one of these transitions and a ground truth of whether each depicts the end of the article.
I invite you to have look at the techniques depicted, to take a guess and see if you are judging their signals correctly, and ultimately to ponder the designs' effectiveness, intuitiveness, and consistency.
