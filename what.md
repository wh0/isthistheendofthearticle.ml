# What?

I'm going to say, sans citation of any sort, that the gamut of attention spans given to reading an article displayed on a phone falls qualitatively short of some possibly nostalgic ideal.
And in commercial publishing, there is an inescapable pressure to design for this state of mind brought by so many readers to the modern news website.
I have no doubt of the incentives that call for and the internal studies that verify the, among countless other innovations that so caringly spangle a comparatively unstimulating wall of text, bullet points of related articles, advertisements for competing cellular providers, pictures and videos of other high profile stories, and interactive offers to buy a subscription to the site, under the bold hypothesis that its works so boring that you'd gladly fill it out instead of reading on.

Yet these pressures are met with a challenge in visual design.
The physical width of a handheld screen circumscribes decades of established practice.
The focus in current mobile web design, or the only option, to put it more drastically, is having a single column and having every element take up the full width.
At the threshold where text meets another element, either intervening temporarily or following after the end, one wonders which case it is, posing the question that sits at the core of this site, "Is this the end of the article?"

This site presents a longitudinal study-in-progress of the techniques that designs across the web use to signal that a given transition from paragraph text to other content happens at the end of an article.
